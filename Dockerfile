# Runtime: scratch — no shell, no package manager. The public control-plane image ships registration,
# janitor, and Plan. The private Cashier image owns all billing service code and Dodo access.
# Registration reaches MAS through its browser-visible HTTPS URL and Janitor's SMTP digest also uses
# verified TLS, so the shared runtime bundle must contain the CA trust store.
#
# The tier controller is intentionally absent from this image. GitHub Actions releases it only as a
# wheel; the standalone telecrypt-synapse builder downloads that exact release asset and verifies
# its checksum after that repository updates its pinned manifest.
#
# CMD defaults to the Registration component. It is a default, rather than an ENTRYPOINT, because this
# one image contains three separately deployed components; Janitor and Plan replace CMD.
