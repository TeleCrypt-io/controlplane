# TeleCrypt.io Controlplane

Public source for the non-payment control-plane components of a TeleCrypt Matrix deployment:

- `registration` provisions Matrix agent accounts without holding a database connection.
- `janitor` runs a single-flight sweep that locks stale accounts and sends owner digests. It never unlocks accounts and reads Cashier-owned billing grants but cannot modify them.
- `plan` is the browser-facing account and plan-management UI at the stable `/plan` URL. It uses MAS OIDC and a narrow signed private Cashier API.
- `synapse/tier_controller` is the fail-closed Synapse capability-policy module.

Cashier, Dodo integration, subscription records, payment-provider credentials, and database migrations for billing are private to the `cashier` repository. This public image contains no Cashier binary or payment-provider SDK.

## Release contract

Every source version uses an exact annotated tag. GitHub Actions tests the source and, only for a
new tag, publishes two distinct artifact types. The tag is the deployment coordinate; immutable
GitHub Release asset evidence binds the published release contents.

- The Go services are released only as `ghcr.io/telecrypt-io/controlplane:<release>`. The image
  contains Registration, Janitor, and Plan; no executable archives are attached to GitHub Releases.
- The GitHub Release, titled exactly `<release>`, contains exactly the
  `telecrypt_tier_controller-<release>-py3-none-any.whl` and the canonical
  `controlplane-<release>.digest.json` image-binding asset. License and notice files remain
  inside the tested wheel; they are not separate release assets. This is the public distribution
  channel for the Synapse module and its provenance record.

The image carries the project `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`. The wheel carries the project license and
notice in its metadata; it has no runtime third-party Python dependencies.

The wheel version must equal the source/image tag. The standalone `telecrypt-synapse` repository
must update its manifest to consume that exact wheel before building its corresponding exact
Synapse image. The shared tag is the exact cross-repository release coordinate, not a claim that
the GitHub Release distributes the Go services. Deployment
configuration, credentials, operating procedures, and production acceptance material remain
private in Harness.

The Go image builder resolves the exact modules recorded in `go.mod` and `go.sum`. One BuildKit
graph exports both the tested local archive and a run-scoped GHCR staging reference; the archive is
loaded and smoke-tested before the version tag is created from the exact verified full-manifest digest.
The release workflow records that digest, source commit, and annotated tag object in the canonical
JSON asset. It separately attaches one build-provenance attestation to the exact GHCR image digest
before publishing the Release. GitHub's immutable-release feature supplies a distinct release
attestation covering the published tag and its two release assets. The workflow proves that a
version tag is absent before creating it and refuses every pre-existing exact version tag; an
existing exact immutable Release is reused only as a complete, independently verified release.

## Repository layout

- `cmd/` contains the minimal `main` packages for the three independently deployed processes:
  Registration, Janitor, and Plan.
- `internal/` contains their shared Go implementation. Go deliberately prevents packages below
  `internal/` from being imported by unrelated repositories.
- `synapse/tier_controller/` contains the public Python package released as the exact wheel for
  `telecrypt-synapse`; it is not copied into the Controlplane container image.

## Browser service boundary

Plan owns the public `/plan` URL, MAS PKCE/OIDC, browser cookies, Origin protection, local MXID
validation, and the plan UI. It has no Dodo, Synapse-admin, or Postgres credentials. Commands are
signed to the private Cashier service, which alone handles checkout, payment webhooks, entitlement
mutation, and Dodo customer portal links.

One-label preproduction configurations visibly render `TEST / SANDBOX — no real charges` on every Plan page. Payment card data is entered only on the Dodo-hosted checkout or customer-portal page, never at TeleCrypt.

`SERVER_NAME` is the sole public-host topology input for Registration, Plan, and Janitor. The exact production name `telecrypt.io`
selects `https://backend.telecrypt.io`; one-label preproduction names such as
`stage.telecrypt.io` select `https://backend.stage.telecrypt.io`. Other hostname shapes are
rejected. The public MAS, Registration, and Plan URLs are derived as `/auth`, `/agents`, and
`/plan` on that backend origin. The exact `telecrypt.io` identity is production; every one-label
preproduction name is an isolated test deployment. Registration, Plan, and Janitor all derive their
environment identity from `SERVER_NAME` alone.

Janitor runs one single-flight sweep per invocation and reads Cashier-owned billing grants through
`JANITOR_DB_URL`, using a separate database credential from Cashier's `CASHIER_DB_URL`. The
URL must use the exact environment database and Janitor role: production uses
`telecrypt_billing` with `telecrypt_janitor_user`, while `<label>.telecrypt.io` uses
`telecrypt_billing_<label>` with `telecrypt_janitor_<label>_user` (hyphens in a label become
underscores in database identifiers). The Janitor role is owner-precreated for the private
`janitor` schema, is read-only on Cashier's private `cashier` schema, and has schema-owner DDL
authority (including CREATE, ALTER, and DROP) only within that private `janitor` schema so the
one-shot can apply its exact migration. The application writes only its own
`janitor_digest_cursor` and `schema_migrations` tables; PUBLIC and other roles must have no ACL on
the Janitor schema. Cashier's billing migration history remains private to the Cashier repository.
Cashier grants it usage of `cashier` and read access to only the
deployment-identity and verification-grant tables.
The private schema and both read-side tables must remain owned by the exact environment Cashier
role (`telecrypt_cashier_user` in production or `telecrypt_cashier_<label>_user` in preproduction);
Cashier durably binds both `SERVER_NAME` and its derived billing environment (`live` or `test`) in
that identity row. Janitor rejects any server or billing-environment drift before it can sweep.

These migrations intentionally accept only the final schema and exact migration digests. An older
or incompatible disposable database must be reset and recreated by the operator; no backward
migration path is provided.

## Registration credential contract

`POST /agents` is the public, rate-limited component for creating an agent account. It
uses only MAS's public password-registration forms, dynamic registration of a public native OAuth
client (`token_endpoint_auth_method: none`), and MAS's device-authorization pages through the
new account's short-lived cookie session. It never receives a MAS/Synapse admin credential, a
personal access token, or a static OAuth client secret, and it never uses Matrix
`m.login.password`.

The one response contains the MXID, generated MAS password, access/refresh tokens, expiry,
device ID, homeserver, and `issuer`/`client_id`/`token_endpoint` needed to refresh directly with
MAS. The password is a recovery credential; agents should use the refresh token. Registration stores
none of those values, logs no credential-exchange details, and sends `Cache-Control: no-store`.
The fixed in-process limiter allows 60 registration attempts per 60-second window per instance. It
is a global backstop; client-facing fairness and any per-client controls belong at the
Caddy/network boundary.

## Development

Requires Go `1.26.4`.

```sh
go test ./...
go vet ./...
```

Run database-backed tests only against an isolated disposable database. Do not commit credentials, database URLs, signing keys, payment-provider keys, or live account data.

The opt-in MAS integration test creates a throwaway account, OAuth client, and device. Run it
only against an isolated disposable MAS/Synapse stack on the local machine. The test accepts only
HTTP loopback URLs on the same origin, with MAS mounted at `/auth` and the Matrix origin at `/`.
The explicit confirmation variable is required so the test cannot be enabled by accident:

```sh
MASREG_INTEGRATION_DISPOSABLE=YES \
MASREG_INTEGRATION_MAS_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8008/auth \
MASREG_INTEGRATION_MATRIX_ORIGIN=http://127.0.0.1:8008 \
go test -tags=integration ./internal/masreg -run '^TestRegisterAndAuthorizeDeviceDisposableMAS$' -count=1
```

Never point these variables at production or a shared test environment. The generated account,
client, device, password, and tokens are disposable test data and must not be retained.
